abstract = {The high-throughput 3D visualisation of biological specimens is essential for studying diseases and developmental disorders. It requires imaging methods that deliver high-contrast, high-resolution volumetric information at short sample preparation and acquisition times. Here we show that X-ray phase-contrast tomography using a single grating can provide a powerful alternative to commonly employed techniques, such as high-resolution episcopic microscopy (HREM). We present the phase tomography of a mouse embryo in paraffin obtained with an X-ray single-grating interferometer at I13-2 Beamline at Diamond Light Source and discuss the results in comparison with HREM measurements. The excellent contrast and quantitative density information achieved non-destructively and without staining using a simple, robust setup make X-ray single-grating interferometry an optimum candidate for high-throughput imaging of biological specimens as an alternative for existing methods like HREM.},

Lett. 112(25), 253903 (2014)], we present a simulation study on the effects of a polychromatic x-ray spectrum on the performance of this technique. We observe that the contrast of the near-field speckles is only mildly influenced by the bandwidth of the energy spectrum. Moreover, using a homogeneous object with simple geometry, we characterize the beam hardening artifacts in the reconstructed transmission and refraction angle images, and we describe how the beam hardening also affects the dark-field signal provided by speckle tracking. This study is particularly important for further implementations and developments of coherent speckle-based techniques at laboratory x-ray sources.},

abstract = {Grating-based phase-contrast computed tomography (PCCT) is a promising imaging tool on the horizon for pre-clinical and clinical applications. Until now PCCT has been plagued by strong artifacts when dense materials like bones are present. In this paper, we present a new statistical iterative reconstruction algorithm which overcomes this limitation. It makes use of the fact that an X-ray interferometer provides a conventional absorption as well as a dark-field signal in addition to the phase-contrast signal. The method is based on a statistical iterative reconstruction algorithm utilizing maximum-a-posteriori principles and integrating the statistical properties of the raw data as well as information of dense objects gained from the absorption signal. Reconstruction of a pre-clinical mouse scan illustrates that artifacts caused by bones are significantly reduced and image quality is improved when employing our approach. Especially small structures, which are usually lost because of streaks, are recovered in our results. In comparison with the current state-of-the-art algorithms our approach provides significantly improved image quality with respect to quantitative and qualitative results. In summary, we expect that our new statistical iterative reconstruction method to increase the general usability of PCCT imaging for medical diagnosis apart from applications focused solely on soft tissue visualization.},

Some bones, such as antler, form and change rapidly, while other bone tissues, such as human tooth dentine, develop slowly and maintain constant composition and architecture for entire lifetimes. When studying apatite mineral microarchitecture, mineral distributions or mineralization activity of bone-forming cells, representative samples of tissue are best studied at submicrometre resolution while minimizing sample-preparation damage. Here, we demonstrate the power of ptychographic X-ray tomography to map variations in the mineral content distribution in three dimensions and at the nanometre scale. Using this non-destructive method, we observe nanostructures surrounding hollow tracts that exist in human dentine forming dentinal tubules. We reveal unprecedented quantitative details of the ultrastructure clearly revealing the spatially varying mineralization density. Such information is essential for understanding a variety of natural and therapeutic effects for example in bone tissue healing and ageing.},

However, the phase retrieval step needed prior to tomographic reconstruction can be challenging especially for strongly absorbing and refracting samples. Near-field ptychography is a recently developed phase imaging method that has been proven to overcome this hurdle in projection data. In this work we extend near-field ptychography to three dimensions and we show that, in combination with tomography, it can access the nano structure of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). The quality of the resulting tomographic data and the structural properties of the anode extracted from this volume were compared to previous results obtained with holotomography. This work highlights the potential of 3D near-field ptychography for reliable and detailed investigations of samples at the nanometer scale, with important applications in materials and life sciences among others.},

However, phase retrieval for optically thick, i.e., strongly absorbing and phase shifting, specimens remains challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate that near-field ptychography can be used to efficiently perform phase retrieval on a uranium sphere with a diameter of about 46 $\mu$m, which acts as an optically thick sample. This particular sample was not accessible by inline holography previously. The reconstruction is based on a statistical model and incorporates partial coherence by decomposing the illumination into coherent modes. Furthermore, we observe that phase vortices, which can occur as artifacts during the reconstruction, pose a greater challenge than in far-field methods. We expect that the methods described in this paper will allow production of reliable phase maps of samples which cannot be accessed by inline holography.},

abstract = {Inline holography is a common phase-contrast imaging method which uses free-space propagation to encode the phase signal into measured intensities. However, quantitative retrieval of the sample's image remains challenging, imposing constraints on the nature of the sample or on the propagation distance. Here, we present a way of simultaneously retrieving the sample's complex-valued transmission function and the incident illumination function from near-field diffraction patterns. The procedure relies on the measurement diversity created by lateral translations of the sample with respect to a structured illumination. The reconstruction approach, in essence identical to that employed in ptychography, is applied to hard X-ray synchrotron measurements and to simulations. Compared to other inline holography techniques, we expect near-field ptychography to reduce reconstruction artefacts by factoring out wavefront imperfections and relaxing constraints on the sample's scattering properties, thus ultimately improving the robustness of propagation-based X-ray phase tomography.},

The advent of ultrabright third and fourth generation photon sources and the continuous development of x-ray optics and detectors has pushed the limits of imaging and spectroscopic analysis to structures as small as a few tens of nanometers. Specific interactions of x-rays with matter provide elemental and chemical sensitivity that have made x-ray spectromicroscopy techniques a very attractive tool, complementary to other microscopies, for characterization in all actual research fields. The x-ray penetration power meets the demand to examine samples too thick for electron microscopes implementing 3D imaging and recently also 4D imaging which adds time resolution as well. Implementation of a variety of phase contrast techniques enhances the structural sensitivity, especially for the hard x-ray regime. Implementation of lensless or diffraction imaging helps to enhance the lateral resolution of x-ray imaging to the wavelength dependent diffraction limit.},

Natl Acad. Sci. USA (2005), 102, 15343-15346]. Two refinements of the iterative constraint-based scheme are developed to address the current experimental realities of this imaging technique, which include missing central data and noise. A constrained power operator is defined whose eigenmodes allow the identification of a small number of degrees of freedom in the reconstruction that are negligibly constrained as a result of the missing data. To achieve reproducibility in the algorithm's output, a special intervention is required for these modes. Weak incompatibility of the constraints caused by noise in both direct and Fourier space leads to residual phase fluctuations. This problem is addressed by supplementing the algorithm with an averaging method. The effect of averaging may be interpreted in terms of an effective modulation transfer function, as used in optics, to quantify the resolution. The reconstruction details are prefaced with simulations of wave propagation through a model yeast cell. These show that the yeast cell is a strong-phase-contrast object for the conditions in the experiment.},

@article{Hahn2012,
abstract = {We present a numerical tool to compare directly the contrast-to-noise-ratio (CNR) of the attenuation- and differential phase-contrast signals available from grating-based X-ray imaging for single radiographs. The attenuation projection is differentiated to bring it into a modality comparable to the differential phase projection using a Gaussian derivative filter. A Relative Contrast Gain (RCG) is then defined as the ratio of the CNR of image values in a region of interest (ROI) in the differential phase projection to the CNR of image values in the same ROI in the differential attenuation projection. We apply the method on experimental data of human breast tissue acquired using a grating interferometer to compare the two contrast modes for two regions of interest differing in the type of tissue. Our results indicate that the proposed method can be used as a local estimate of the spatial distribution of the ratio $\delta$/$\beta$, i.e., real and imaginary part of the complex refractive index, across a sample.},

@article{Thibault2008,
abstract = {Coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) and scanning transmission x-ray microscopy (STXM) are two popular microscopy techniques that have evolved quite independently. CDI promises to reach resolutions below 10 nanometers, but the reconstruction procedures put stringent requirements on data quality and sample preparation. In contrast, STXM features straightforward data analysis, but its resolution is limited by the spot size on the specimen. We demonstrate a ptychographic imaging method that bridges the gap between CDI and STXM by measuring complete diffraction patterns at each point of a STXM scan. The high penetration power of x-rays in combination with the high spatial resolution will allow investigation of a wide range of complex mesoscopic life and material science specimens, such as embedded semiconductor devices or cellular networks.},

abstract = {Coherent diffractive imaging using a coherent X-ray source promises to be a useful microscopic method for imaging noncrystalline objects at high spatial resolution. In this article a simple method to estimate the coherently scattered signal as a function of resolution is presented, and it is shown that the required X-ray flux or dose scales as the inverse third power of resolution for a specimen of constant volume and density. A simulated case study using the proposed energy-recovery linac source is also presented, which confirms the estimated flux requirement.},

abstract = {Ptychography is a coherent diffractive imaging method that uses multiple diffraction patterns obtained through the scan of a localized illumination on the specimen. Until recently, reconstruction algorithms for ptychographic datasets needed the a priori knowledge of the incident illumination. A new reconstruction procedure that retrieves both the specimen's image and the illumination profile was recently demonstrated with hard X-ray data. We present here the algorithm in greater details and illustrate its practical applicability with a visible light dataset. Improvements in the quality of the reconstruction are shown and compared to previous reconstruction techniques. Implications for future applications with other types of radiation are discussed.},
